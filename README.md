# Tankery

A co-operative Tanking game demo/proof-of-concept


Based on the following pitch document:

---

### The basic concept:
Multiple players work together to control an armored fighting vehicle.

Fight against AI or other human-crewed tanks

for a single-crew option, have the radio operator also command the rest of a tank platoon

#### Roles
* Commander
  * Acquires targets
  * Can also function as the radio operator
* Gunner
  * Ranges targets
  * Aims and Fires Gun(s)
     * Rotates Turret
     * Elevates Weapon
* Driver
  * moves the chassis

Loaders(and bow/machine gunners) existed, but I don't see that as being a particularly enjoyable role for a player.

#### Possiblities:

* VR
* Custom-built AFVs
	* See: Crossout
* Multiplayer Matchmaking
	* Queue up to be put in a tank with other humans
